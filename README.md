# Sram_Puf_Project
Final Project - design and simulation of a 64-bit SRAM based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) in 45nm CMOS using Cadence Virtuoso, featuring error correction and reliability analysis
## 🔍 Project Overview
The project started with the design of a single 6T SRAM cell used as a basic PUF element.  
After successful simulation and analysis, the design was expanded into a 64-bit SRAM PUF array.

To achieve good randomness and stability, I carefully adjusted transistor widths and balanced device sizing.  
Monte Carlo simulations were performed to verify the statistical randomness of the PUF responses.

Currently, the next step is to integrate **error correction** and test the design under **extreme temperature and voltage conditions** to evaluate reliability.

## 🧩 Tools and Environment
- **Technology:** GPDK 45nm CMOS
- **Software:** Cadence Virtuoso, Spectre, VHDL
- **Analysis:** Monte Carlo, corner simulations (TT, SS, FF), voltage/temperature variations

## 📈 Current Status
- ✅ Designed and simulated a single SRAM-based PUF cell  
- ✅ Built and verified a 64-bit array version  
- ✅ Achieved balanced transistor sizing and good randomness  
- ➡️ Next: implement error correction and test under environmental stress
